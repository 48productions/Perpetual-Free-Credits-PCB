# Perpetual Free Credits PCB (a.k.a. the PFC PCB)
This is a simple circuit/PCB design for a a reversible, non-destructive arcade cabinet addon board.
It's designed to keep your games fully credited up at all times, perfect for arcade games that either lack a Free Play mode, or are missing features in Free Play mode that are present in Credit mode.

This design is currently a WIP, and is not fully tested. A prototype using similar (but not identical) parts is confirmed to work on a limited set of games (a.k.a. one cabinet).


# Compatibility/Installation


# Components

## Timing Resistors

These values may need to be tweaked during testing.

Off time: R2 (10k + 9k)

Speed: R1 (1k) + VR1 (~4k)


# Credits/Disclaimers

This project came about because of a relevant conversation in the awesome western arcade rhythm game community, and the general concept/design was discussed by several community members.
